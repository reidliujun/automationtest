'''
    shard library of launcher module

    This part share functions from launcher, well, lots of case will use
    operations about launcher as launch an app from launcher,back to launcher and so on.
    We integrate such functions here ,all cases can use it freely.

    1.How to use it in case:

     >>> from qrd_shared.launcher.Launcher import Launcher
     >>> launcher = Launcher()
     >>> launcher.launch_from_launcher(app_name)

    in order to support multi language, the 'app_name' here is not the app name string itself,
    it is a string id in resource file in launcher/res/values-xx, the string will be located
    dynamically according to current locale.

    2.More shared functions of launcher can be added here,any modification
    here must guarantee the api not change since it may be used by cases not in your scope.

    3.We have met an issue that sometimes launch an app from launcher by click its icon can not starup the app,
    we are sure the click event is done, but the app did not start.This occurs the first time which means if there are
    10 cases to launch mms , only the first case will fail to launch.Root cause isn't clear now.It is not reproduced 100%.
